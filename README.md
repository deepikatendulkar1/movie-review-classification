# 🎬 Movie Review Classification

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. The reviews are preprocessed and converted into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF vectorization**. The model was trained and evaluated, achieving an accuracy of **85%**.
